(AP) -- The sheriff's initial estimate of as   many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark  apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building  counted some victims more than once. Sheriff John Stone said Tuesday afternoon that there could be as   many as 25 dead. By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death  toll was 15, including the two gunmen. The discrepancy occurred because the SWAT teams that picked   their way past bombs and bodies in an effort to secure building  covered overlapping areas, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. ``There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were   constantly getting different counts,'' Davis said. As they gave periodic updates through the night, Davis and Stone   emphasized the death toll was unconfirmed. They said their priority  was making sure the school was safe.

(AP) -- Students returned to classes Thursday at   Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High  haunted the halls. Jittery staff and students walked past armed  guards and cried and hugged inside. At one point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after a   backpack scare. Dozens of students streamed out of the school hours  early, unable to stand the tension any longer. ``It's like a prison in there,'' said Jessica Miller, 15. ``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then   they time you,'' said Holly Bernside, also 15. ``All the teachers  are wearing nametags, and there is one at every door.'' The school's marquee proclaimed ``Rebels our thoughts are with   you.'' Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine  High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and  dozens wounded. Columbine is about three miles away. Armed deputies stood guard at the only entrance and students   needed their parents' permission to leave. Students leaving the school said the intense security inside   scared them. ``It's very uncomfortable in there. There are a lot of people   crying,'' said Tyler Herbert, 16, a sophomore. Rumors quickly spread, these days fueled on the Internet as well   as by phone, that ``Chatfield would be next,'' said Ms. Miller, a  sophomore. Parents drove up and asked a reporter if it was true  that a student was barricaded inside a classroom. It wasn't. Students were forbidden to leave their backpacks lying around.   Some of the bombs used in the assault at Columbine were planted in  knapsacks. The principal came onto Chatfield's public address system and   urged students to wear ``more moderate clothes both in school and  when you go out,'' Ms. Bernside said. The killers at Columbine wore  black trench coats. The arrival of two bomb squad trucks with sirens blaring further   shook those inside. The bomb squad was called because a backpack  had been found unattended in a hallway. It contained books. A pizza delivery followed. The school wanted to make sure there   was enough to eat since students couldn't leave campus for lunch  and get back in. Diane Hitchingham of the Jefferson County school system said   schools were getting phony bomb threats. School officials kept  reporters out of Chatfield and other Jefferson County schools. Ms. Bernside, a sophomore, said all the efforts to counsel   students and banners in the school lamenting the deaths made things  worse. Joe Murphy, a 16-year-old sophomore, said that anyone with a   free hour was required to go to the school's commons. Herbert interjected: ``I'm a little worried about putting all   the kids in one place. If someone wanted to come and start shooting  again it would be real easy for them.'' A couple of hours after Chatfield opened, Nancy Hoag decided to   pull her daughter, Melissa, 15, out. ``I was a little nervous about  her going back and it is scary in there,'' she said, her voice  choking. ``We have friends whose children go to Columbine,'' Mrs. Hoag   said. ``They were lucky, but why do you have to be lucky?'' Herbert said he had to leave because ``I needed a smoke. I went   three hours without one.'' Barbara Monsu, who oversees the county's high schools, said more   students than expected had come to class. Chatfield has 1,870  students. She said the school was allowing students to stay home. ``But the kids want to be here,'' she said. ``They need to be   here.''

Fifteen people, including the two killers, died Tuesday in a   shooting and bombing spree at Columbine High School. ``The massacre is a tragic reflection of the dark side of   American society,'' Buchanan told reporters Wednesday. ``At  Littleton, America got a glimpse of the last stop on that train to  hell America boarded decades ago when we declared that God is dead  and that each of us is his or her own god who can make up the rules  as we go along.''

Columbine on Saturday morning to pray. The women, both mothers of two young children, bowed their heads, closed their eyes and whispered, ``Oh, God please bless the families who lost children,'' and they began to cry. ``Please comfort them and be with them, and comfort the people of this town. Please comfort this town.'' Littleton needs comfort. Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs. The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Littleton needs comfort. Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt. Columbine, a hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball fields. The first few visitors climbed over slushy snow that melted quickly as the sun finally made an appearance after three days of snow. As the day progressed, the snow became thick mud and as many as 100 visitors at a time came to the top of the hill to look at the rough wood cross that had been staked into the ground there. They bent to leave flowers, poems, balloons and other mementos of grief at the base of the cross, then stood to gaze at the familiar town that seemed to look different after such a loss. Most of Littleton is visible from the top of Mt. Columbine _ the rows of roofs, the sidewalks, the strip malls and trash cans, the basketball backstops above garage doors. Physically, it's the same town it was Monday. But 15 of its own are gone, and the loss resonates deeply and profoundly. Many wonder what to do now. How do people experiencing grief and anger and confusion and intense sadness navigate the unfamiliar paths to peace? ``I don't know,'' said Debbie Ellwanger, a 10-year Littleton resident. ``Nobody knows where to go from here. I think we have to learn from this and not let those kids die in vain.'' She and her husband, Larry, trekked through the dirty snow up Mt. Columbine on Saturday, fingers laced together as they cried for the children. ``They shouldn't have died,'' Larry Ellwanger said. His wife nodded: No, they shouldn't have died. So they came to the wood cross on top of Mt. Columbine to try making sense of something that never will. Below the hill, in the middle of the baseball field, someone had built 13 small snowmen in an even circle. Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and possibly never will. On top of Mt. Columbine, though, people thought more about healing and pulling together and getting through. ``All we can do is come together,'' said Carrie Goertz, 16. ``It's just something that all the barriers have been broken and people have to accept and take care of each other. There's always going to be differences between people, but we've got to look past that, the exterior stuff, and just be together, be unified.'' ``And we've got to take advantage of our time with our family and friends,'' Aimee Jensen, 18, added quietly. The tragedy at Columbine has brought unity that for now is unbreakable _ it has reached around the world and drawn in the thoughts and prayers of people far removed from suburban Colorado. The memorials in Clement Park testify to the depth of grief that those who didn't lose loved ones in the massacre feel. They bring cards and flowers, donate food and building materials, thinking about how impossibly sad it is when people _ particularly children _ die without reason, about what they would have done if it had happened to someone they love, about the people suffering most. One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial sign and said: ``Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better.'' The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight: guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth, community togetherness, peace. Hopefully they are issues that will not be forgotten when time passes. But for now, for the next several weeks, people seem able only to get through the worst of it, to handle the realization that some people are not coming back and that yes, things like this do happen here. And that somehow, life keeps moving. ``That's the strange things,'' said Aaron Burningham, 27, looking out across Littleton from the top of Mt. Columbine. ``It seems like life should stop, but it doesn't.''

(AP) -- They streamed in from all over --   hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed  at comforting a town torn asunder. One good wish, soaked by the  morning rain, was signed, simply, ``Your community.'' But what community was it from? So many forms of community,   rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have  come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to  tell. In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown   of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has  produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis,  still thrives. ``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our   community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway  said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by  70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself. There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine   students and Columbine Valley residents. There are myriad  mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students,  their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel,  united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and  Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's  anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community. The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver,   past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of  the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the  community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done  to stop this thing.'' The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating   outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has  become a mourner's Lourdes. Fast-food restaurants are flying flags at half-staff and posting   sympathy signs. Businesses are contributing goods and raising  funds. Denver's newscasters have donned blue Columbine ribbons.  Big-league sports teams canceled games in deference; Mile High  Stadium now sports a giant Columbine ribbon visible from Interstate  25. Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes,  between strangers. ``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so   self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our  community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot  drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since  Tuesday. ``It's when something like this happens that we realize the   community's there for us,'' she said Sunday. After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came   in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that  repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger  community.'' Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into   town. Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share  grief. In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P. Kenneth  Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as  ``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of  Littleton.'' What unifies regions this way? A national culture, for one -- the   very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence.  Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief,  creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet  users that didn't exist 40 years ago. Thus, people who don't know  each other can mourn together. ``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of   grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. ``One of the hidden  truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us  together.'' In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of   35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its  existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving  as salves for recuperation. Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte   River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since  the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and  houses sprouted up around it. This was long before the retail  sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and  make the area a suburb. ``A community formed around that high school, and the school   grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened  Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years. ``It  has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a  suburban high school.'' Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses   continue to sprout. And the families that have streamed into  Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace  unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together  that the Columbine deaths caused. ``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst. People may   not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter. We  knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R.  Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how  people cope with public tragedy. ``That sense of reaching out makes  us feel better.'' That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people   sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist. Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping   that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry  boys' violent acts can last. ``If they would have known the revival they have started, they   never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose  daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. ``They wanted death and  destruction. Instead, we've all come together.'' ", "APW19990425.0114": "Thousands Mourn Columbine Victims. 1999-04-25 23:42:18. usa. LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Comforting each other with ceremony and   song, Columbine High School's mourners turned a strip-mall parking  lot into an arena of grief and promised each other they would reach  past their pain. Vice President Al Gore brought the 70,000 heartbroken people a   message Sunday: ``You are not alone.'' Investigators, spending the day at the memorial service, were to   resume their work this morning, conducting more interviews and  eyeing the possibility of additional suspects in Tuesday's  massacre. Of the 12 students slain, three were to be laid to rest today. A   funeral also was scheduled for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher  hailed as a hero for shepherding students to safety during the  attack. Sunday's outdoor ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of   the snow-capped Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of  students, singers and public officials tried to make sense of the  week's events. Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight --  even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial  ribbons. ``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High   School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This  community will not be beaten.'' Christian singer Amy Grant began a tribute song to the victims   with a gentle lament: ``So much pain and no reason why.'' Bagpipe  players played ``Amazing Grace'' and four F-16 jets flew over in a  ``missing-man'' formation after 13 doves were released -- one for  each victim. Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen sang a tribute they wrote.   Jonathan Cohen, a junior, was trapped in the Columbine choir room  when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria where  many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs. ``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious   ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain  will take our pain.'' Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis called the gathering ``the   end of a nightmare.'' Religious leaders urged trust in God. And  Gore, thundering like a preacher at a revival, underscored that  bloodshed like that allegedly caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric  Harris must remain an aberration. ``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for   the spirit of America,'' Gore said. ``America is a good and decent  place, and our goodness is a light to all the nations of the  world.'' The pair, enraged by what they considered taunts and insults   from classmates, allegedly rampaged through their school with guns  and bombs before turning their weapons on themselves.  Investigators, amazed at the sheer firepower, are trying to  determine if others were involved. Police have found a diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail,   as well as bomb-making materials and weapons in one of the pair's  bedroom. More interviews were set for this week; more than 500 have  already been conducted. Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for   the day, concentrating on directing traffic for the shopping-center  ceremony. At times, the service took on the flavor of a somber pep rally.   Senior Amber Burgess, after eulogizing Sanders, urged the crowd to  persevere and invoked school spirit. ``We are!'' she yelled. ``Columbine!'' thousands replied. Then the proceedings moved en masse to Clement Park, adjacent to   Columbine and -- as long as the school remains cordoned off -- the  mourning place of choice and site of a vast makeshift memorial.  Hundreds lined the procession route. ``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good   community, and all the kids love each other. But to see the kids  and the community come together was just amazing,'' said Scott  Rathbun, a senior. Nick Foss, 18, grazed by a bullet while helping teachers and   students hide in a closet and overhead air ducts, limped behind  Gore and was supported by DeAngelis. Mourners applauded as they  passed, and Littleton firefighters walked beside Foss, patting him  on the back. ``God Bless you guys!'' a man shouted. ``You've got a reason to   live.'' On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a   church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16. He was a cross-country runner who had recently returned from a   two-week trip to Paris with the French club; she was an aspiring  songwriter and author eager to get her driver's license. The  victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong to  neighboring churches of the same Roman Catholic archdiocese. Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800   students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at  Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate  Columbine's overflow. Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at Fiddler's   Green, a suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts --  one baby step toward normalcy -- and in defiance of the gunmen. ``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come   together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends  Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the  hope.''

LITTLETON, Colo. _ Vice President Al Gore on Sunday bid farewell to Columbine High School's dead, issuing a ringing challenge to parents and schools before a crowd of 70,000. ``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,'' said Gore, in a forceful speech filled with religious references less than a mile from the site of the worst school killing in U.S. history. The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs. Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then killed themselves. Gov. Bill Owens acted as master of ceremonies during the 75-minute memorial service that included speeches from Archbishop Charles Chaput, and Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham. Singers Amy Grant and Michael Smith joined a large bagpipe band in providing music for the crowd, joining two Columbine students who wrote a song in honor of their fallen classmates. In the crowd were people who had driven hundreds of miles to pay their respects. ``It's something that can help us personally by coming and seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain. It's just something that struck my heart,'' said Tim Weitzel, who with his wife, Donna, drove from Grand Junction to attend the service. Owens extended his sympathy to the families of the slain and wounded, some of whom gathered in front of the crowd, while the archbishop told them that ``love is stronger than death.'' ``Confronted with an unimaginable evil, this community has grown closer,'' Owens said. The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the students of Columbine, Gore said. He asked the crowd ``to feel the embrace of hundreds of millions.'' ``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us together,'' Gore said. ``Here in Jefferson County, the spring has yielded to the cold winter of the heart.'' Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for parents and schools. Decrying the violence and cruelty of pop culture, Gore said parents must cushion their children against hate. ``If you are a parent, your children need your attention,'' Gore said. ``If you are a grandparent, they need your time.'' It's too easy for children to get guns, and schools must focus on discipline in teaching character, he added. In his only comment that addressed the killers, Gore called for forgiveness. ``We must have the courage not to look away, either in life or in death, from those who feel despised or hated,'' he said. Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine. The suspects were not mentioned by name during the service, although Chaput also asked they be forgiven. Graham praised the Columbine community for uniting under the pain of a tragedy that could have torn it apart. He seized the opportunity to chastise public schools for being empty of ``the teachings of God.'' ``They are indeed dangerous places,'' Graham said. Owens closed the memorial by reciting the names of the 12 students and one teacher killed and releasing a white dove for each, as many in the crowd wept and light rain fell. It was a message of hope that was repeated throughout the day. ``Love is stronger than death _ I believe that,'' Chaput said. ``Love is stronger than death.''

The students are scheduled to begin classes Monday at another   school a few miles away in afternoon sessions until the end of the  year, said Barbara Monseu, area administrator for the Jefferson  County School District. Students were originally scheduled to go back Thursday. Calling the return to the classroom ``a very important next step   in the process of healing,'' Monseu said the first thing Columbine  students will do when they arrive at Chatfield High School is  attend an assembly to reunite them with their teachers. ``The teachers are very anxious to see their students again,''   she said. Columbine and Chatfield are sports rivals, but junior John Danos   said he welcomed the newcomers. ``I'm fine with it,'' he said. ``We're going to treat them   normal.''

(AP) -- Columbine High School junior Matt Wells   took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile,  chew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball. ``It's just good to be smiling and laughing,'' he said. Wells, a 16-year-old catcher on Columbine's varsity baseball   team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on  Wednesday. There were cheers and grins here, eight days after  teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12  students and a teacher before killing themselves. Among other things, the gunmen had complained about their   treatment at the hands of athletes at Columbine. When they burst  into the library on April 20, one of the gunmen yelled: ``All jocks  stand up! We're going to kill every one of you.'' Since the massacre, the suburban school has become a sealed   crime scene. Hundreds of backpacks and other personal belongings  abandoned in the crisis still litter the hallways and classrooms.  School athletic equipment is also trapped, probably for the rest of  the school year. But thanks to an outpouring of donations and support from the   community and the sports world, Columbine's baseball team has  uniforms, gloves, balls and everything they need to get back on the  field. Without the equipment and clothing donations, the Columbine   Rebels would have been forced to end their season, Wells said. ``We wouldn't have played,'' he said. ``We wouldn't have been   able to.'' The baseball team has received an estimated $5,000 worth of   clothing and gear from Reebok, Mizuno, Denver Athletic Supply and  other sports companies. The gifts include dozens of bats, stark  navy blue uniforms, never-used leather gloves, even socks. ``They're taking care of us,'' coach Robin Ortiz said. ``I hate   to say it, but it's been like Christmas at times.'' Team members decided they wanted to play out the rest of the   season. ``For a lot of them, it's a chance to start healing,'' he said. Some players also had the chance to realize a dream. The   Colorado Rockies opened their doors to Columbine players Monday,  allowing the team to work out in their hitting cages and tour Coors  Field. The Rockies worked with the Denver Police Activities League to   help coordinate the donations and support. League director Nick  Arcuri said he hopes the efforts show the teens they are not alone. ``I was around these kids at practice the other night and some   of them are afraid to smile,'' he said. ``They need to know that  people out there care.'' The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.   Katie Crona, a junior varsity soccer player with the Rebels, said  her team received new uniforms from Adidas and assistance from  rival Arapahoe High School. ``They've been so wonderful to us,'' the 14-year-old freshman   said. ``It's so nice to know they care.'' Some players said the donations and support will encourage them   to play better. But Wells said he is more interested in simply  trying to have fun and move beyond the tragedy that put his life on  hold. ``It's like getting back to normal life,'' he said.

NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago. Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial. ``We are waiting for this, for justice,'' he said, ``and we feel strong.'' The mother, Kadiadou Diallo, and two of her children, are expected to arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on Thursday morning. She had been expected Tuesday, but had to cancel her flight because the U.S. Embassy in the Guinean capital of Conakry was unexpectedly closed Monday and she was not able to pick up her visas. The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political protest that has yet to abate. Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant who worked as a street peddler in Manhattan and attended computer classes, was shot in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4. He was unarmed. The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times. Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson plans to meet with the Diallos shortly before 2 p.m., when the grand jury indictments are scheduled to be unsealed in open court. Johnson has refused to confirm reports, based on people familiar with the case, that the officers will be charged with second-degree murder. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the daily protests over the Diallo shooting and is an adviser to the family, also is expected to attend the meeting, said Steven Reed, Johnson's spokesman. Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem has helped finance the Diallo family's trips to and from New York City. A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting, Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury voted on the charges last Thursday. Asked if the timing of the arraignment was scheduled to accommodate the Diallo family's travel plans, Reed said he would not comment. It is not unusual for a prosecutor to brief a victim's family on criminal charges, he added, even in cases far less publicized than the Diallo case. ``It is the district attorney's practice to have families of the deceased hear about grand jury results in advance,'' he said. During their stay in New York City, Diallo's parents will have a packed schedule of meetings and rallies, organized by Sharpton, that will keep them in the spotlight. When they came in February, shortly after their son's killing, they attained near-celebrity status _ trailed by television cameras, greeted by crowds and transported from place to place by motorcade. Friday, both parents are expected to meet with many of the people who were arrested for civil disobedience during protests at Police Headquarters over the last several weeks. Charles Barron, an organizer of the protests, said the Diallos would speak at rallies organized around other high-profile cases in which the police are accused of brutality against young black men. He said they would be taken to U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, for example, where a jury is being selected to hear the case against police officers charged with brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima. The parents, according to Sharpton, will stay in New York City for about 10 days. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also plans to be in the Bronx on Wednesday. The mayor is scheduled to rename the block in front of the 50th Precinct station house, on Kingsbridge Avenue at West 236th Street. The block will named for Officer Vincent Guidice, who died in May 1996 after he fell on the shards of a broken mirror while responding to a domestic dispute. Outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday, about 400 off-duty police officers chanting ``No Justice, No Police'' and ``Its a Tragedy, Not a Crime'' rallied to show support for the four police officers before their expected arraignment. ", "NYT19990330.0350": "OFFICERS ARE SAID TO TELL OF SUSPICIONS ON DIALLO. 1999-03-30 23:10. . NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case. Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious when two of them got out of their car to question him and he retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday. The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their case. Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which hit him. The shooting led to 15 days of protests outside Police Headquarters and reignited the gnawing debate about police in New York City. During the outcry the officers, their lawyers and law-enforcement officials have remained silent about what set off the shooting. But several officers are said to have told associates that the chain of events that led to the fatal shooting of Diallo began when the officers first spotted him and thought that they saw him looking into the window. The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m. when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No. 1157. The officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived. McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and approached Diallo on the stoop. McMellon stood to the left and Carroll to the right as they mounted the steps. What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers. The four police officers have yet to officially explain their actions. But several officers told associates that after the officers identified themselves and asked to talk to Diallo, he retreated into the building's vestibule and appeared to be trying to reach the inner door, the people with knowledge of the case said. Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said. According to this account, several officers told associates that while Diallo was in the vestibule, he made a move that led them to believe he was armed: he turned to his right, reached into his pocket and pulled something out. It turned out later to be his black wallet. At that point, Carroll yelled, ``Gun!'' the people knowledgeable about the case said. Some of the details were first reported Tuesday in The New York Post. It was unclear from Tuesday's accounts who fired the first shot. As the first gunshots rang out, McMellon fell backwards down the steps and injured his tailbone, causing at least some of his colleagues to believe that he had been hit by return fire, people knowledgeable about the case said. Carroll moved to his right and continued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car, began firing as well, they said. Several of the officers are said to have told associates that they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they had unleashed the fusillade. When the officers saw afterward that Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said, at least one of the officers wept. ", "APW19990331.0161": "NYC Cops Charged in Shooting Death. 1999-03-31 16:21:02. usa. NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with   murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail  of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a  painful examination of police tactics and race relations. Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard   Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree  murder. They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder  charges. Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no   criminal record, was shot 19 times Feb. 4 in his vestibule by  members of an elite street-crime unit looking for a rape suspect.  Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo  had a gun. The slaying has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already strained   relationship with the black community, and many have accused him of  failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger. Giuliani said Wednesday: ``We should allow the criminal justice   system to now operate.'' Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,   even though District Attorney Robert Johnson had asked that they be  held without bail. The officers left the courthouse together  shortly after the arraignment. Johnson told the judge: ``On Feb. 4 in the vestibule in his own   building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless  when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him.  ... These four defendants intended to take his life.'' After leaving court, one of the officers, Carroll, shook hands   with supporters and said in a quivering voice, ``I want to thank  the New York City police officers and the Street Crime Unit for  their undaunted support.'' The officers were immediately suspended from their jobs. Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the intentional murder   count ``ludicrous.'' ``What's the district attorney saying? That they had nothing to   do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him  because he's black?'' the lawyer asked. Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said in court that Johnson   had ``succumbed to a political agenda. My client is innocent of all  charges. There was no crime on February 4.'' In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have   been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged  police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the  perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by  police stop-and-search tactics. Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo's friends   and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute  arraignment. About 1,000 demonstrators stood outside the  courthouse. Since the slaying, the street-crime unit has been ordered to   wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the  predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police  officers. The case also reflects tension over police attitudes and tactics   nationally. Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was  worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine  the fight against crime. The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand   jury. Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing   because they saw one officer on the ground. McMellon supposedly  slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo. James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick   feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and  he reacted.'' Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir   attended a tribute to a police officer killed in the line of duty  in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of  the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall  our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and   pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said. ", "NYT19990331.0403": "FOUR N.Y. OFFICERS INDICTED IN SHOOTING OF AFRICAN IMMIGRANT. 1999-03-31 20:38. . NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton stepped to the microphone outside the Bronx County Couthouse and bellowed: ``The police in there have just been charged with murder in the second degree,'' and the crowd of hundreds whooped and cheered. It was the first time ever that a New York City police officer has been indicted for murder, according to prosecutors and police spokesmen, though a few have faced manslaughter charges. The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges. State Supreme Court Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer, which was expected to be met. Police commissioner Howard Safir suspended the officers from the force immediately after announcement of the indictment, which was returned by a grand jury last week but officially unsealed just Wednesday. What happens next could intensify, rather than quell, the racial tensions that have been simmering in the two months since the shooting. Wednesday's indictment coincided with the start of jury selection in the trial of the five officers in Brooklyn who were indicted in last year's torture and sodomy, inside a stationhouse bathroom, of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. The Louima trial, too, is bound to be perceived _ and treated _ as a showcase of the dark underbelly of the N.Y.P.D. Potential jurors have been instructed to fill out a 42-page questionnaire, asking 128 questions, such as ``Do you think there is a prospect of social unrest following a verdict in this case?'' and ``Have you ever been exposed to persons who show, or who have shown, racial, sexual, religious, or ethnic prejudice?'' and ``How would you rate the job the New York City Police Department is doing in dealing with crime?'' The Diallo case has spawned three official investigations _ by the US Justice Department, federal prosecutors, and the New York state attorney general _ into a possible pattern of racial discrimination in the department's practices. Meanwhile, some police are shouting back. A few hundred off-duty officers rallied outside the Bronx courthouse Wednesday, as well, some shouting, ``No justice, no police'' _ a threatening play on Sharpton's chant, ``No justice, no peace.'' Inside the courtroom, though, the atmosphere was solemn. The four officers, wearing suits, sat stonefaced. Among the spectators, on one side of the aisle were Diallo's parents, who had flown in from Guinea for the occasion, along with friens and relatives. On the other side were friends of the officers. There were no outbursts. Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes. Later in the day, lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who is representing Diallo's parents, announced he will sue the city for civil damages, saying, ``We will be relentless in our pursuit of justice.'' The Diallo shooting has set off the largest protests the city has seen in years _ and cast a serious blemish on the pride of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's five years as mayor. Crime has dramatically declined, with murders down by over 70 percent, to the lowest point since the early 1960s. But many people are now wondering if the social cost _ white officers behaving too aggressively and intrusively in minority neighborhoods _ might be too high. In a 15 days leading up to Wednesday's indictment, 1,203 people _ including prominent officials, lawyers and other professionals of all races and religions _ were arrested in Sharpton-led civil-disobedience protests outside police department headquarters. Those protests are now over, but Sharpton promised Wednesday, ``We will keep on marching, we will keep the pressure on.'' Lawyers on both sides Wednesday offered previews of the cases they will argue when the trial starts April 30. Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson noted New York law does not require him to prove premeditation on the part of the four officers. Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in conduct which created a grave risk of death.'' The defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired. One lawyer said his client, Richard Murphy, did not fire until he saw McMellon fall. McMellon had slipped on the sidewalk, but Murphy thought, his lawyer said, that he had been shot. ", "NYT19990401.0006": ". 1999-04-01 00:18. . The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers' lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide. Stephen Brounstein, the lawyer for Boss, and James Culleton, the lawyer for Murphy, both said that their clients heard gunfire and saw McMellon on the ground, leading them to assume that McMellon had been shot. After the arraignment, Kornberg said his client, Carroll, had seen a ``black object'' _ which turned out to be Diallo's wallet _ coming out of the victim's back pocket. ``My client saw him reaching into his back pocket, saw this black object come out and my client yelled `Gun!''' Kornberg said. After the court proceedings, the officers briefly thanked their supporters, and proclaimed their innocence. Eyes welling, brows knitted, Murphy said, ``I did nothing wrong and this trial will show that I did nothing wrong.'' But the Diallos, who met with Johnson for half an hour before the arraignment, and their supporters expressed satisfaction with the indictments. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone in this life,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, at a news conference after the arraignment at the Manhattan law offices of Johnny Cochran, who said he would prepare a civil suit on behalf of the Diallo family. Police officers have rarely been convicted for killings that occurred while they were on duty. The last such case was in July 1997, when Officer Paolo Colecchia was convicted of second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back as he fled down a Bronx subway platform. ", "APW19990401.0274": "Diallo Case Shows Courtroom Divide. 1999-04-01 09:35:09. usa. NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou   Diallo left the prosecutor's office. Black bystanders fell in behind the couple Wednesday as they   marched two blocks to a courthouse where four white police officers  pleaded innocent to murder charges in the shooting death of the  Diallos' son, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no  criminal record. The officers heard cheers, too -- from scores of their off-duty   colleagues, most of them white. ``On Feb. 4, in the vestibule in his own building, Amadou Diallo   stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless when 19 of 41 shots were  fired at him, struck him and killed him,'' prosecutor Robert  Johnson told the court. ``These four defendants intended to take  his life.'' The case has inspired a painful examination of police attitudes   and tactics across the nation. Earlier this month, President  Clinton said he was worried that recent charges of police  misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in   demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Many of  the protesters -- white and black, celebrities and common folk --  also demonstrated against the alleged police torture of Haitian  immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the feeling that law-abiding  minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search  tactics. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother,   Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was arrested at a Feb. 19 rally   protesting the Diallo killing, praised prosecutors for taking what  he called ``the first step in the pursuit of justice'' but added  that ``justice will not prevail until the officers are punished for  the crime.'' ``Even under duress,'' Jackson said, ``those who are called to   uphold the law must be held at a higher standard.'' The killing has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already tense   relationship with New York's black community. Many have accused him  of failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger over the  incident. Giuliani declined to comment on the charges, but said earlier in   the day: ``We should allow the criminal justice system to now  operate. ... Now you move to another stage in which the crime has  to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard   Murphy -- who were searching for a rape suspect and fired apparently  believing Diallo had a gun -- showed little emotion when the charges  were read. Each was indicted on two counts of second-degree murder and one   count of reckless endangerment. They could get 25 years to life in  prison on the murder charges. Judge John Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,   although Johnson had asked that they be held without bail. The  officers were immediately suspended from the force. They had been  on desk duty. Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the murder count   ``ludicrous.'' ``What's the district attorney saying, that they had nothing to   do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him  because he's black?'' he asked. Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court,   offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went  wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment  building. James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick   feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and  he reacted.'' Culleton and Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said their   clients fired because they saw an officer on the ground. McMellon  reportedly slipped and fell as the officers confronted Diallo. Boss ``believed there was a fire fight was going on,''   Brounstein said. At a news conference, Johnson criticized the officers for   choosing not to testify before the grand jury which voted last week  to indict them. ``Having exercised that right, they cannot then say, `We're   police officers, therefore what we did was OK,''' he said. ``Without explanation, what we have is four people driving up to   a location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual.'' The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized daily protests against the   shooting, praised the grand jury's action. ``We can only say that it is appropriate that these policemen   have been indicted for murder,'' he said. Diallo's father would  only say, ``I'm very happy.'' Since the shooting, New York's street-crime unit has been   ordered to wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at  the predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority  police officers. Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir   attended an emotional tribute to a cop killed in the line of duty  in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD  critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' ``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and   pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said. ", "NYT19990401.0410": "IN DIALLO CASE, ALL SIDES SEE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AS CRUCIAL. 1999-04-01 22:27. . NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details. Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges. Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting? How quickly did he fall? Is there anything at the crime scene to explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed man? The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it: _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing range. _ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced bullet trajectories with lasers. _ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the prosecution's experts propose. _ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his initial wounds. ``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil suit in the case. ``You can question their story based on common sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard. But none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective, irrefutable scientific evidence.'' Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same irrefutable science to argue a opposite position. ``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder. ``What the forensic evidence will not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body. Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely, the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired at a standing person.'' Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case will hinge on forensic evidence. Assuming the officers testify, their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive factor. But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to contradict one another. ``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``But what often happens is that one side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets polluted.'' The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial. But the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing the civil suit. One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers' assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him. There are apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account, although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting. But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage. ``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord severed,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the defense.'' The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people who have reviewed the report have said. The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate points. Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's conclusion that he was paralyzed. Wecht's analysis that those shots came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity. But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the chest were fired. ``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said. ``You can't tell which is first and which is second. Any medical examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross examination.'' A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot also figure to be a source of debate. The city's autopsy indicates that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report have said. The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen. Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds. There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward McMellon fell down while firing. ", "NYT19990401.0413": "SETTING A SCHEDULE IS THE NEXT LEGAL STEP. 1999-04-01 22:34. . NEW YORK _ Now that the four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a schedule for the pretrial proceedings. That meeting is set for April 30 at the state Supreme Court in the Bronx, before Acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams. Defense lawyers will be given a timetable in which to make their motions, or requests to the court. Prosecutors will be given deadlines to respond to those motions. If the matters are likely to be contested, the judge might set dates for hearings. Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer representing Officer Sean Carroll, said Thursday that in addition to standard motions like those for discovery _ in which lawyers ask prosecutors to hand over the information they have collected _ he expected defense lawyers to ask the judge to review the grand jury minutes to decide if the indictments were supported by the evidence. A request for a change of venue is also possible, he said. Kornberg also said he plans to ask the court to review grand jury attendance records to make sure that a quorum were present each day, and that the grand jurors who voted to indict the officers were present to hear all the evidence presented. ``If they weren't present, or there wasn't a quorum, these indictments may be dismissed on motions,'' Kornberg said. After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial. Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic. ", "NYT19990501.0002": "FOUR OFFICERS IN DIALLO CASE RETURN TO WORK; TRIAL SET FOR JAN. 3. 1999-05-01 00:04. . NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set. They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building. But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of division. Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward McMellon. Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of interest now since he was representing only one of them and might be forced to cross-examine the others. It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious that Kornberg would like for me to go.'' Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working, adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or badges. Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what police officials called administrative assignments. Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible pretrial motions. The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in, like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. That case is set to begin on Tuesday. Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic, ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding that more would be forthcoming. The judge said the next court appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions. While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases. Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case, which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients. But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, off the case. Kornberg said later that if Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate trial for Carroll. The issue of severing the cases is important because the defendants will probably need one another's testimony to corroborate their accounts of the shooting. For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _ were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.

China will soon finish building its  first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in  studying the endangered animals' blood types and chances of  accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday. The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and  Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province  will be completed this year, the China Daily said. Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help  researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas  have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources  said. Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood  types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack  sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang  Yan said. The centre will hold a general survey of the blood types of all  the 81 pandas being kept there, and collect and store their blood to  better prepare for the protection and rescue of pandas in the wild. To boost their blood, researchers currently give pandas  injections of glucose and medicine, but blood transfusions are more  effective in helping the animals improve their immunity and  accelerate the process of recovery. A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas  because data on the pandas' blood types and DNA information will be  readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool. China has 163 giant pandas in captivity. There are only about 1,590 of the endangered species living in  the wild, all in China, though the numbers have risen steadily in  the past decade after plunging to around 1,100 in the 1980s.

About 100 giant pandas in  northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died. By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants,  had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature  Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in  China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature  reserve administration. The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,  with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of  Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To protect the animal,  dubbed China's \"national treasure,\" the country has set up 33  nature reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares. The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100  giant pandas. Currently, they are threatened by a severe food  shortage in the wake of the withering bamboo. What is worse, arrow bamboo on another 1,950 hectares which blossomed in 1993 has not  grown tall enough for consumption. Since it usually takes 15 years for the new plants to grow adequately to supply enough food for  groups of pandas, food remains scarce for the pandas. To help pandas tide over the difficult period, many townships  in Gansu Province have set up rescue teams to care for the rare  animals. ", "XIN_ENG_20050213.0159": "Panda's habitat becomes greener. CHENGDU, Feb. 14 (Xinhua). Forest coverage in southwestern  Sichuan Province has increased to 27.94 percent from 24.3 percent  in 2003, making the region, a major habitat of giant pandas, a  greener home, according to the local government. More than 20 million hectares of forest have been brought under protection and 3.61 million hectares of forest have been planted  since 1997. This is a result of two provincial projects, the  natural forest protection and cultivated land reforestation, said  Yang Dongsheng, head of the provincial forestry department. \"We have given priority to the afforestation in the habitats,  especially nature reserves, for giant pandas,\" said Yang. The province's efforts have paid off. The latest national  survey on giant panda, which was organized by the State Forestry  Administration, showed that the population and habitat of the  pandas in Sichuan have both increased 30 percent during the past  seven years. \"Now China has about 1,700 giant pandas and 76 percent of them  live in Sichuan,\" said Yang, adding that the provincial government has obtained a financial support of more than 24 million yuan (2. 89 million US dollars) for nature reserve construction from the  central government. \"We will definitely first consider the panda natural reserves  when planning how to use the money,\" said the official.

The discovery of panda traces in  Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates  that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau  said. On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui  Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda  and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a  local mountain. Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda. They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major  habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous  efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the  region over recent years. Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s  but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of  the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu  in southwestern Sichuan province. A project to protect the natural forest was kicked off in the  area in 1999. The Shaanxi provincial government approved the  establishment of the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve in 2002. Wang Wanyun, head of the bureau's Wildlife Protection section,  said that traces of giant pandas have also been left and spotted  in neighboring Zhouzhi and Liuba counties over the past two years. The third national survey on giant pandas, which began in 2000  and ended last year, shows that pandas live in mountain areas of  20 towns of eight counties along the east-west Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province. A total of 273 wild giant pandas have been  spotted in an area of 347,864 hectares, which officials say means  there are 7.8 pandas on per 100 sq km, the highest density among  all pandas' habitats in China. Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas  protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats. Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of  dinosaurs and regarded as a \"national gem\" of China. About 1,590  giant pandas are still at large in the wild, mostly in the high  mountains around Sichuan Basin, and 160 live in captivity. The central and provincial governments have invested 160  million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection  programs since 1992. China built its first natural preserve for  giant pandas and began to ban poaching in the 1950s. The pandas  have been put under state protection in the past four decades  since 1962.

China's endangered panda is migrating  into forest areas restored by the government, the re-discovery of  its dung in northern Shaanxi province indicates, state press  reported Wednesday. Scatologists identified the panda droppings in the region's  Qinling mountains where it lived 30 years ago, while locals have  reported sighting animals resembling the bear, Xinhua news agency  reported. The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the  Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government  to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said. The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the  giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province. Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with  some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while  the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in  a separate report. \"In terms of bio-diversity protection, Qinling and Sichuan  pandas need equal protection, but it is a more urgent task to rescue  and protect Qinling pandas due to their smaller number,\" Wang  Wanyun, chief of the Wild Animals Protection section of the Shaanxi  Provincial Forestry Bureau, told Xinhua. Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of  dinosaurs, are cited as a \"national gem\" of China. The Qinling  pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about  50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said. Last week Xinhua reported that some 7,420 hectares of bamboo,  the panda's favourite food, bloomed and died in December in  neighboring Gansu province, 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of the  Qinling mountains.
