Rescue crews worked through the night into one morning sifting through piles of rubble in search of survivors after a towering crane at a construction site toppled like a tree across a city block, destroying buildings and killing at least four people.
The crane was to have been extended so workers could start work on a new level of the planned 43-story building, said an owner of the company that manages the construction site.
