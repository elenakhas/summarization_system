A report in a Japanese newspaper said that if the system of organ donation were regulated, the Philippines could see a rush of foreign patients, including from Japan, where 10,000 people are awaiting kidney transplants.
The allegations, if true, would constitute a grave breach of the nation's organ transplant rules, well as a public relations setback for those promoting organ donation.
State law specifies that transplant physicians or surgeons are not allowed to be involved in the treatment of potential organ donors before they are declared dead.
