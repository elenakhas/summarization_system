Near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur, killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack.
The blasts all struck within the old walls of Jaipur, a city in western India that's known for its pink-hued palaces, and suspicion fell on Islamic militant groups blamed for a string of attacks on India in recent years.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm, while the United States condemned the wave of bombings.
