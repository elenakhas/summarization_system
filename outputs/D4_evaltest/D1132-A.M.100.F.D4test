Jeff George, curator at Sea Turtle Inc., a nonprofit turtle rescue group on South Padre Island, said 42 of the endangered juvenile green turtles were released and 46.
He said Malaysian marine police seized the turtles from the Hainan fishermen's trawler last month after they were caught in the waters off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island.
Hundreds of endangered sea turtles have been found dead along Bangladesh's coast over the past two weeks, triggering concerns about pollution and local fishing practices.
