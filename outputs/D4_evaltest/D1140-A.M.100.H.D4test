At least eight people died in floodwater or flood-related incidents in three northern districts, and about 1 million people were marooned by floodwater in about ten districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country.
The government's flood forecasting and warning centre said the situation could worsen in the next few days as major monsoon and Himalayan-glacier fed rivers are expected to crest.
