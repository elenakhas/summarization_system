Alvarez parked his sport utility vehicle on railroad tracks, causing a Metrolink train to derail and strike another Metrolink train going the other direction on Jan. 26, 2005.
Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.
He is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson and train wrecking, along with special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders and train wrecking stemming from the crash.
