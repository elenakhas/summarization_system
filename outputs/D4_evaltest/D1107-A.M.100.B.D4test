In the fourth mass food poisoning incident to hit China in a week, thirty-four students were hospitalized with suspected food poisoning after eating lunch at a factory cafeteria in Fujian Province.
Sun said the 2006 food safety evaluation campaign will cover three major indices--urban government performance, consumer satisfaction and food safety inspection.
Last year China experienced a string of food safety problems including steroid- tainted pork, parasite-infested snails, turbots that contain excessive amount of carcinogens, and ducks that were fed cancer-causing dye to make their egg yolks red.
