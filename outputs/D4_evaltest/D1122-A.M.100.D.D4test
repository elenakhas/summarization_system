At least six people were killed after a bridge over the Mississippi river collapsed, plunging cars and trucks together with massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters.
Engineers spotted structural problems in the bridge as back as 1990, but state officials thought patches and yearly inspections would be to keep it, Minnesota's top bridge engineer said.
