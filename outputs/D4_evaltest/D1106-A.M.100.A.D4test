International fisheries officials have agreed on an unprecedented action plan to reverse the decline in global tuna stocks, including a plan to track each fish from the ocean to the market.
In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more than 20 percent in 2007.
Japan is the world's biggest tuna consumer, eating one quarter of the global catch.
