Roberts walked into the one-room West Nickel Mines Amish School with a shotgun and handgun and barricaded himself inside after letting the boys go.
State police have said Roberts might have been planning to assault the Amish girls but there was no evidence that he did.
A driver who worked with Roberts said he picked up milk from some of the farms where the children in the school lived.
