Potential defense witnesses for Charles Taylor are refusing to testify at the former Liberian president's war crimes trial for fear of being slapped with U.N. travel bans, Taylor's lawyer told a court.
Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging his trial in Sierra Leone, where the Special Court sits, could trigger fresh unrest in the war-scarred African nation.
He did not give details on the meetings, but said he was optimistic the court would raise enough money.
