Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast.
The hijacking was the latest in a surge in Somali pirate attacks this year and highlighted the vulnerability of large ships moving through the area.
The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
