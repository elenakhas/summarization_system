The Army's surgeon general criticized stories in The Washington Post disclosing problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, saying the series characterized the living conditions and care for soldiers recuperating from wounds at the hospital's facilities.
Kiley said the Army was beginning to study ways to streamline the medical bureaucracy, including the process by which soldiers are evaluated and either discharged or returned to active duty.
The walls of one soldier's room were covered with black mold, and the ceiling of his shower had a large hole.
