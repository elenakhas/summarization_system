A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels, of crude oil off South Korea's stormy west coast, officials said, in what was estimated to be the nation's largest maritime oil spill.
If oil reaches the shore it will cause enormous long-term damage to the environment along the coast, which is dotted with many seaweed and oyster farms.
