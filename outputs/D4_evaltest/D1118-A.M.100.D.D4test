The teenage gunman who went on a shooting rampage in an Omaha department store, killing eight people, may have smuggled an assault rifle into the mall underneath clothing.
Surgical nurse Debora Maruca-Kovac, whose family took in Hawkins after her 17- and 19-year-old sons befriended him, said she saw victims of the mall shooting being brought in to the hospital where she works.
Maruca-Kovac said Hawkins was fired from McDonald's this week and had broken up with a girlfriend.
