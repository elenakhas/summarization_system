President George W. Bush ducked a pair of shoes hurled at his head in the middle of a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
At his news conference with al-Maliki, Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003.
Bush joked, saying that all he can report was that it was a size 10 shoe.
The second shoe came, and Bush ducked again while several Iraqis grabbed the man and dragged him to the floor.
