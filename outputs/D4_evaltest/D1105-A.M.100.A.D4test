An Indonesian lawmaker criticised what he said was the slow deployment of search and rescue teams to a mountainous area of Sulawesi island where a plane carrying 102 people crashed.
Matanga sub-district's air zone is prone to air pocket notably during wet season, he said, adding that Matanga air zone is similar to Masalombo air zone in South Sulawesi province which is prone to air pockets.
Rescuers reached the scene after walking accompanied by local residents, search and rescue team member Suyatno was quoted by the national Antara news agency as saying.
