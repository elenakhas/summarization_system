Virginia Tech authorities and the police are investigating the identities of those killed well as the gunman in the campus shooting rampage, a Virginia Tech spokeswoman told Xinhua.
It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and came eight years to the day after 13 people died at Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who killed themselves.
U.S. media reported that a total of 32 people, including the gunman, were killed and 29 others wounded in the shooting rampage.
