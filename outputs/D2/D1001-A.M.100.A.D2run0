LITTLETON, Colo. _ Vice President Al Gore on Sunday bid farewell to Columbine High School's dead, issuing a ringing challenge to parents and schools before a crowd of 70,000.
``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,'' said Gore, in a forceful speech filled with religious references less than a mile from the site of the worst school killing in U.S. history.
