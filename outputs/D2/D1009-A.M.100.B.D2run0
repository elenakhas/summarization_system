BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors posted a photograph of a   white, furry bear dressed as Santa Claus on an Internet site  Thursday in a plea for public help with the JonBenet Ramsey slaying  investigation.
District Attorney Alex Hunter said investigators are hoping   someone can identify the stuffed animal's manufacturer and  retailers where it was carried in 1996 or before.
Suzanne Laurion, Hunter's spokeswoman, said investigators had   been unable to find that information despite trying retailers,  Internet sites and manufacturers.
