Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick  of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast  China's Heilongjiang.
The discharging move was made with the approval by the State  Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
The Fengman Hydropower Station in the upper reach of Songhua  River increased the daily discharge amount from 600 cubic meters  per second to 1,000 cubic meters per second starting from 10:00  a.m. Thursday.
The flow is expected to return to 600 cubic meters  per second in the evening.
