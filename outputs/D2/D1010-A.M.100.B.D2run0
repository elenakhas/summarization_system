EU embargoes on British beef from animals aged over 30 months could be lifted from next year following a 95 percent fall in the number of cases of mad cow disease recorded in Britain over the past three and a half years, according to a European Commission report released Monday.
A 48-month-old cow that died has been confirmed as having had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
