Maryland may be rushing crucial research on introducing Asian oysters into the Chesapeake Bay, the states of Delaware and New Jersey said this week, joining several federal agencies in asking that the new species be studied further.
By next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
That is Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993--and a staggering 15 million in the glory days of 1885.
