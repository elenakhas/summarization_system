The Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal officials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central financing authority with the power to disperse billions to various Chesapeake-related projects.
The idea is to jump-start the massive cleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged down because of excessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.
But supporting the financing authority doesn't make it so: There's still the matter of persuading Congress to come up with the bulk of the $15 billion needed to pay for the plan.
