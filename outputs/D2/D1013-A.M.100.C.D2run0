SAN FRANCISCO _ Marvin Young Jr. got home from work one evening and found a certified letter from the Sacramento police that changed his life.
``There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud,'' said Young, who lives in Oakland.
``I nearly fainted.
I'd never even been to Sacramento.''
That was in 1991.
Seven years later, he is still fighting to clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
