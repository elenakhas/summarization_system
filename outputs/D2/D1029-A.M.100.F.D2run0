A fierce gunbattle between paramilitary troops and renegade tribesmen left eight soldiers dead and 23 others wounded in an insurgency-wracked area of southwestern Pakistan, a troop spokesman said Friday.
Officials failed to provide information on casualties among the tribesmen in Thursday's clashes, but denied tribal elders' claims that dozens of civilians had died.
Separately, a bomb exploded in the toilet of a train elsewhere in restive Baluchistan province on Friday, killing one person and wounding five others, two critically, police said.
