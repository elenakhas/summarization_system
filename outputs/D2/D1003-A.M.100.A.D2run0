The discovery of panda traces in  Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates  that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau  said.
On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui  Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda  and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a  local mountain.
