Police launch fresh search of Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch (ADDS details).
LOS ANGELES, Dec 23 (AFP).
Police and investigators probing child molestation charges against superstar Michael Jackson on Friday launched a fresh search on his famed Neverland Ranch, detectives said.
The reason a warrant was issued for the latest search was not immediately clear.
An initial swoop on the sprawling estate in California took place just over a year ago.
