The new suspected cases involve a 19-year-old girl who is in critical condition, a three-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl who are at present under treatment and in satisfactory condition, the DH said in its daily update on the influenza Wednesday afternoon.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the``bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
