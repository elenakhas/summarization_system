Fla. _ Hurricane Floyd got stronger and headed toward the Bahamas Saturday, packing 110 mph winds and leaving weather pundits wondering whether it will hit South Florida this week.
The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye blowing at 155 mph.
If it stays on its current path, Floyd would hit the coast of Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach.
