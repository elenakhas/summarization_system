Jeanette Fitzsimons told New Zealand's National Radio she had discussed with Australian Green Party leader Bob Brown the idea of``some trans-Tasman consumer action against Japan if they succeed"in getting approval from the International Whaling Commission for an expanded whale hunt.
Green Party lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand are considering urging consumers to boycott Japanese products to protest Tokyo's plan to expand its annual whale hunt, the party's co-leader said Monday.
Tokyo is believed to have the votes needed to get its request approved at the Ulsan meeting.
