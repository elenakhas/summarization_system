Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
A team of about 30 workers was tackling the problem.
"The situation is still serious," Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for the Norwegian oil group Statoil which operates the Snorre A offshore platform, told AFP.
