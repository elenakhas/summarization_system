addressing a gathering on Sunday at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture in Bogor,  60 kilometers of the capital, Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais has asked Soeharto to donate his wealth to the nation and called on Indonesians to forgive the former president who had made great contribution to the country.
Ghalib came under fire after he said on Monday that he believed Soeharto's public denial of charges that he had accumulated a fortune worth billions of U.S. dollars during his rule.
