Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
No one questions that Yellowstone's grizzlies have rebounded over the past three decades since they were listed--the population has been growing at a rate of 4 to 7 percent a year for several years--in part because state and federal officials abolished trash dumps that used to lure bears and bring them into dangerous contact with humans.
