WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent outbreaks of listeriosis are causing an   immediate public health problem, federal agriculture officials said  in launching a review of whether to require more testing for the  deadly bacterium.
Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more   legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they  recommend recalls, so they can warn the public faster.
