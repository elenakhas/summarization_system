ATHENS, Greece--A Cypriot passenger plane with 121 people on board crashed Sunday of the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over the controls and that there was no sign of the pilot.
The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.
