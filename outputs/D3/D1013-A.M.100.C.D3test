San FRANCISCO  Marvin Young Jr. got home from work one evening and found a certified letter from the Sacramento police that changed his life.
"There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud," said Young, who lives in Oakland.
He was arrested for the crimes committed in his name.
Seven years, he is fighting to clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
I've worked hard and made a late payment in my life, but this other guy has messed up everything for me. ''
