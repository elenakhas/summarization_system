Another woman, who is 20 and 5-foot-8, has an opposite eating pattern.
Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs 99 pounds.
She exercises to the point of exhaustion five mornings a week because, though she is bone-thin, she thinks her thighs are flabby.
Her periods are irregular, but she has gone more than three months without menstruating.
She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m.
