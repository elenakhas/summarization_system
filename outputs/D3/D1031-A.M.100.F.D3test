In southern India saving lives.
For generations, the Irula tribe in southern India made a living out of skinning snakes.
A 1972 wildlife law banned such sales and the tribals, who lived in seaside forests, turned to fishing and worked on a government program to restore coastal mangrove swamps damaged by human development.
The tsunami struck on Dec. 26, the mangroves in the Pichavaram wetland acted as a buffer, saving the Irulas and about a dozen fishing hamlets from the killer waves.
