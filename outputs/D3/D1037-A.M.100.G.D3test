The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for $12 billion for cleaning up the bay.
The Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal officials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central financing authority with the power to disperse billions to various Chesapeake-related projects.
The idea is to jump-start the massive cleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged because of excessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.
