China's largest tropical rain forest will get further protection the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen while warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says.
