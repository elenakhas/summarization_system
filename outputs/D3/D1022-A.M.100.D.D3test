Nz mulls over stopping Japan's whale slaughter in World Court.
New Zealand is seeking all options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to kill endangered humpback whales.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
Carter, who is to attend the IWC meeting and taking a case to the World Court is one option.
