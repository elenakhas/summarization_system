-- Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
We will transport a mobile hospital and associated Australian Defense Force medical personnel to the disaster area to provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims," Downer said Saturday in a statement.
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft in PNG on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's remote north.
