An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian authorities turned a military barracks compound into an avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies.
