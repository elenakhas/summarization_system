Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
