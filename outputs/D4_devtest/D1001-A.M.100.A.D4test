The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed Tuesday two gunmen into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs.
Authorities believe Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and killed themselves.
Gov. Bill Owens acted as master of ceremonies during the 75-minute memorial service that included speeches from Archbishop Charles Chaput the son of evangelist Billy Graham.
In the crowd were people who had driven hundreds of miles to pay their respects.
