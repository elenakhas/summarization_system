California adopts groundbreaking stem cell research measure.
Californians voted Tuesday to become the first US state to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that was banned by President George W. Bush.
Supporters of the measure say the decision could help find cures to diseases including cancer, AIDS Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease than had been expected.
They claim that the measure will make California, the United States' leading hub for biotech industries, a world hub of stem cell research too.
