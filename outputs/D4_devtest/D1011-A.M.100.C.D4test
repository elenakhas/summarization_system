Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs 99 pounds.
Her periods are irregular, but she has gone more than three months without menstruating.
Another woman, who is 20 and 5-foot-8, has an opposite eating pattern.
She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m.
She eats, whatever she can get her hands on.
She maintains a normal weight of 130 by forcing herself to vomit.
