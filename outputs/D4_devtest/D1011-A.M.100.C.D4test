Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, even though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs 99 pounds.
Her periods are irregular, but she has gone more than three months without menstruating.
She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m.
She eats, whatever she can get her hands on.
Her favorite pastime is to sit in front of the television with a gallon of mocha-chip ice cream.
