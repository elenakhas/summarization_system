A draft proposal to take the grizzlies off the endangered species list went out this summer from field offices of the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week.
Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and recovered.
