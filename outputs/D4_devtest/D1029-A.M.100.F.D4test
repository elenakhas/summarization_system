Clashes with tribesmen leave eight Pakistan soldiers dead; bomb on train kills one.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, that happened as the train stopped in a station in the town of Mach, near Quetta, the provincial capital.
It follows a series of small explosions targeting Baluchistan's railways in the past two months and blamed on ethnic Baluch nationalists.
The ensuing battle lasted 16 hours, ending early after the two sides agreed on a cease-fire, said a Frontier Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik.
