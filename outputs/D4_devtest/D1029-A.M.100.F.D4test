Clashes with tribesmen leave eight Pakistan soldiers dead; bomb on train kills one.
Officials failed to provide information on casualties among the tribesmen in Thursday's clashes, but denied tribal elders' claims that dozens of civilians had died.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, that happened as the train stopped in a station in the town of Mach, near Quetta, the provincial capital.
It follows a series of small explosions targeting Baluchistan's railways in the past two months and blamed on ethnic Baluch nationalists.
