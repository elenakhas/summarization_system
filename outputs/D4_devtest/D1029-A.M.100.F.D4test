Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials and paramilitary forces to leave.
Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others.
Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region.
