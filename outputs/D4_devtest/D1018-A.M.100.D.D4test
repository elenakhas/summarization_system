Police question father of Dutch teen arrested in case of missing teenager in Aruba.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
The attorney general's spokeswoman, Mariaine Croes, said witnesses are questioned when prosecutors believe they may be able to add something to the case.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
