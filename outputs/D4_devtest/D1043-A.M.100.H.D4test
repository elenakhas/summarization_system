Saudi Arabia rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
They came from throughout the country in an emotional and charged tribute to Hariri, the former prime minister, billionaire developer and architect of Lebanon's revival from a devastating 15-year civil war.
