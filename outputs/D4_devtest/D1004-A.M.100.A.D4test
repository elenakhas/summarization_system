Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft in PNG on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's remote north.
The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map, leaving hundreds people dead or missing.
Downer said the federal government stood ready to consider further requests for assistance from the PNG government.
