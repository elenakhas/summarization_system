The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map, leaving hundreds people dead or missing.
The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on one night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area.
Many of the villagers are believed to have died instantly as the deadly wall of water struck without warning, sending their homes crashing into the raging torrent.
