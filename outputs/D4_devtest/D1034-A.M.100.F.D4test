Mine tries to dig out from under local discontent in Peruvian Andes.
Gerardo de la Cruz, a 42-year-old farmer, is one of thousands who spent two weeks blockading a U.S.-run gold mine in the Andes, the latest example of the uneasy relationship between Peru's rural poor and the mining industry.
Yanacocha isn't the first mining company to run up against broad public opposition.
Mining is key to Peru's economy, which has been growing at about 4 percent annually since President Alejandro Toledo took office in 2001.
