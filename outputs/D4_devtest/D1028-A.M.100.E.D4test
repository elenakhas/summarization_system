The judge in the trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
The former college math instructor is charged separately in New Jersey in connection with a fifth bombing.
The defense had asked that lists of licensed drivers, well as lists of registered voters, be used to broaden the pool of ury.
Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12.
