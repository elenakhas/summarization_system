By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall, sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast.
Floyd was moving due west at 14 mph today, but was expected to begin turning by evening, taking a west-northwest course.
All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under hurricane warnings today.
