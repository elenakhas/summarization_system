China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse.
Under the program tropical rain-forest trees will be planted, along with tropical fruit trees and economic trees.
