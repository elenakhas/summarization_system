The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.
