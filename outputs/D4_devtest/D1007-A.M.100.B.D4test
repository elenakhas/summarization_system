The Public Health Department of Macao has called on residents to avoid contacting birds, and take proper protective measures if they have to.
Although several cases were reported in Hong Kong, none was found in Macao far.
It is unclear in which way human being catches the virus.
In addition, it reminded people to avoid staying with birds for a long time in a closed space where ventilation is poor.
People should see doctors immediately for proper treatment if they have fever or respiratory diseases.
