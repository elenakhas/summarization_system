Vietnam decided to undertake next month a nation-wide census of Agent Orange victims, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
The results of the census are intended to be used by the Vietnamese government to work out relevant policies for the well-being of victims, and to call for stronger support from domestic organizations and international assistance for victims.
Congenital deformity and disability caused by exposure to the toxic chemical during the war can be found in the second generation of people exposed to it.
