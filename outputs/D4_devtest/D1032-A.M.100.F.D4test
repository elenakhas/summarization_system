Norwegian oil group Statoil said that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
A team of about 30 workers was tackling the problem.
The suspension of operations means a loss of 130,000 barrels per day out of a total of some three million bpd produced by Norway, the world's third-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Statoil said it did know when production would be able to resume.
