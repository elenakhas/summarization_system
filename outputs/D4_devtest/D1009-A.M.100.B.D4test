Prosecutors posted a photograph of a white, furry bear dressed as Santa Claus on an Internet site Thursday in a plea for public help with the JonBenet Ramsey slaying investigation.
District Attorney Alex Hunter said investigators are hoping someone can identify the stuffed animal's manufacturer and retailers it was carried in 1996 or before.
She refused to say anything more about the toy the bear came to the attention of police and whether police had it in their possession.
