During the murder trial of Robert Blake, the public has been privy to one bizarre scenario after another, grist for a true-life pulp novel.
His wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was a woman with a reputation as a grifter and gold digger, who the defense contends trapped Blake into an unloving marriage by becoming pregnant with his child.
Closing arguments ended with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
