Marine life could take centuries to recover from killer waves by Madeleine Coorey.
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
The disaster has left more than 120,000 people dead and to five million displaced in the region, with Indonesia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka the worst affected countries.
When a tsunami passes, reef structures grind into each other causing extensive damage.
