The discovery of panda traces in Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau said.
A project to protect the natural forest was kicked off in the area in 1999.
The Shaanxi provincial government approved the establishment of the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve in 2002.
Wang said, Shaanxi has established 13 giant pandas protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.
