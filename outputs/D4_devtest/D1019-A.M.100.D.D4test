A total of 20 people were taken hostage by six armed men one night from Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the abduction are to be confirmed.
The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included two French tourists, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese, well as a Filipino worker and nine Malaysians.
