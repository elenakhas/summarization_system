Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia.
Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and that they were in Sabah.
He said most of the hostages were Europeans and Americans.
Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared with Indonesia.
