Pfizer Inc. warned doctors that one of its bestselling painkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients.
An initial study last year raised similar concerns in the same kinds of patients.
Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx cast suspicion on the safety of drugs in that class.
Officials of the Food and Drug Administration said that a meeting about these issues will occur in January.
Bextra is the company's new and faster-acting version of Celebrex.
