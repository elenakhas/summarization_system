In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
This is the first time Golkar declared war against corruption, collusion and nepotism.
During the 32 year rule of Soeharto, Golkar had been in the government bandwagon, given an amen to all the regime's policies and whims.
A clause in a decree can be ignored, but a specific decree would give the needed impetus to kick start the investigation.
