In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
A clause in a decree can be ignored, but a specific decree would give the needed impetus to kick start the investigation.
The demonstrators in great number moved toward residence of the former president at Jalancendana street in Central Jakarta.
But they failed to reach the target point because of tight security precautions at various intersections that lead to the spot.
