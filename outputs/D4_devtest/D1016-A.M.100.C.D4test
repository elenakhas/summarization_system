Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar faction has changed its position.
Students and citizens in the country have held various demonstrations, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism during his 32-year rule.
