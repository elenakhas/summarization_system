The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed to lobby Capitol Hill for $12 billion for cleaning up the bay.
The idea is to jump-start the massive cleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged down because of excessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.
There's the matter of persuading Congress to come up with the bulk of the $15 billion needed to pay for the plan.
Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner, the Chesapeake executive council's outgoing chairman, said the lobbying effort would begin soon.
