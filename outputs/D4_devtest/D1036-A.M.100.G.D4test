The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
Authorities have denied the charge, and some pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.
The prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late October.
This question will require a great deal of time and serious investigation.
I think it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin Wall.
