The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
Authorities have denied the charge, and some pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.
The prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late October.
This question will require a great deal of time and serious investigation.
Yushchenko said massive street protests in central Kiev's Independence Square had brought historic change to Ukraine.
