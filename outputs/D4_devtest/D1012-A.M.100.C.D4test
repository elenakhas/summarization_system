Greek radio and television stations reported that the air force pilots in the two fighter jets did not see any movement in the cockpit of the airliner before the crash and it was unclear if the two pilots were in their seats.
The Cypriot airliner that crashed in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that starved the pilots of oxygen.
