Rice reaffirms support for Northern Ireland peace deal.
WASHINGTON, June 29.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza  Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern  Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of  the Good Friday accords.
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of  intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a  power-sharing executive and assembly.
"The United States continues to support fully the British and  Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords,"  State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
