US gears for political battle after Supreme Court Justice  resigns by Stephen Collinson.
WASHINGTON, July 2.
US Republicans and Democrats geared  up Saturday for a major political battle over a successor to Supreme  Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has announced her  retirement.
Her decision, announced Friday, handed President George W. Bush  his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court,  which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets  the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.
