WHERE QUIXOTE TILTED, A BATTLE RAGES OVER WINDMILLS.
CAPE TRAFALGAR, Spain.
Near this blustery headland where Admiral Nelson won his great naval victory over the French two centuries ago, a new battle of Trafalgar is brewing.

Two companies plan to build large clusters of windmills in the sea just off this stretch of Spain's southern shore, a gritty place of sand dunes, lagoons and sharp brown reefs.
