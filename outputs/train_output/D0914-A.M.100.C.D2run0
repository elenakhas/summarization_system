Israeli FM asks Egypt to help rescue Israeli wounded.
JERUSALEM, Oct. 8 (Xinhua).
In the wake of three explosions that had killed at least 35 people in Egypt's Sinai Desert, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Friday asked his Egyptian counterpart to help rescue Israeli wounded.
Quickly after the blasts, Shalom asked for Egyptian permission to allow Israelis to pass through the border without checks and to fly rescue workers into the Sinai.
