US to tighten issuance of driver's licenses.
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua).
Applicants for state-issued  driver's licenses in the United States will be required to produce four types of identification when the Congress approves a plan to  discourage illegal immigration, the USA Today newspaper reported  Thursday.
Most who apply for new licenses -- and presumably, those  seeking renewals -- would have to prove that they are in the  United States legally, possess document of their social security  number and home address and show a photo ID.
