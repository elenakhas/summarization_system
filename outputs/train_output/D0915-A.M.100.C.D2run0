Rocket Slams U.S. Embassy Ahead of Iraqi Voting.
BAGHDAD, Iraq.
Hours before Iraqis headed to the polls for a momentous vote, a rocket struck the U.S. Embassy compound Saturday inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, killing two people and shattering the relative calm of election eve in the capital.
The rocket attack marked a rare direct hit for insurgents, who frequently target the sprawling embassy complex but have never before killed anyone inside.
