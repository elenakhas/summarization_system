ABC ANCHOR JENNINGS BATTLES CANCER.
ATLANTA.
"World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer, ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the job throughout his treatment.
He and ABC News President David Westin sent e-mails to their newsroom colleagues about the diagnosis, which Jennings received Monday.
Westin called the news "a tough assignment," while Jennings, 66, said it was "quite a surprise."
