PROSECUTORS REWRITE SCRIPT IN TRIAL OF EX-TYCO OFFICIALS.
ATLANTA.
Prosecutors rewrote their opening script for the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz on Wednesday, purging the most striking accusations of lavish spending that they had concentrated on during the first trial.
Instead, prosecutors focused on laying out the core theme of their case, saying the two men, former Tyco executives, had illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders.
