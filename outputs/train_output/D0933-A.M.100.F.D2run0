IBM, EPFL join forces to study cognitive intelligence.
LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua).
IBM said on Monday that it is  teaming with a European institute in a research initiative to  uncover the secrets of human cognitive intelligence.
Scientists from IBM and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de  Lausanne (EPFL) of Switzerland will work together over the next  two years to create a detailed model of the circuitry in the  neocortex -- the largest and most complex part of the human brain, IBM said.
