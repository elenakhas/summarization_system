Kashmiris Demand Role in Peace Talks.
SRINAGAR, India.
The leader of moderate Kashmiri separatists warned Thursday that lasting peace between India and Pakistan would be impossible unless his people were seated at the negotiating table.
During more than a year of talks with Pakistan, India has refused to let Kashmiri leaders have a direct role in deciding possible solutions to the 57-year conflict over Kashmir.
